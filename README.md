# promoter_classification

### Project description

This project is dedicated to the development and evaluation of classification models for the task of identifying DNA sequences that function as promoters. In addition to binary promoter identification, a secondary objective is to assess the feasibility of classifying promoters based on their strength (e.g., strong vs. weak promoters).

### The project includes the following files and directories:

`data/` — Folder containing:

- Raw datasets for binary and strength prediction tasks;
- Embeddings generated by external models (DNABERT, HyenaDNA, Nucleotide Transformer).

`model_selection/` — Contains scripts and notebooks for:

- Training and evaluating models;
- Performing hyperparameter tuning.

`embeddings_scripts/` — Scripts for generating embeddings:

- get_bert.py — Generates embeddings using DNABERT;
- get_hyena.py — Generates embeddings using HyenaDNA;
- get_nt.py — Generates embeddings using the Nucleotide Transformer.

`EDA` — Initial exploratory data analysis of the DNA sequences.
